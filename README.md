# Docker Spring Boot Startup Time Measurements

## Introduction

This repository is dedicated to measuring the startup times of a Spring Boot application under various configurations.
The goal is to compare different techniques and configurations that can be used to optimize the startup time of Spring
Boot applications, especially in the context of containerized environments like Kubernetes.

The measurements are performed using Docker, and the results will help in understanding how different configurations
affect the startup time of a Spring Boot application. The focus is on configurations such as using Spring Native, Spring
Indexer, Layertools, Class Data Sharing (CDS), Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compilation.

## Why does startup time matter?

In modern cloud-native applications, startup time is a critical factor. Faster startup times lead to:

- Improved scalability: Applications can scale up more quickly in response to demand.
- Reduced cold start latency: Particularly important for serverless applications where functions need to start quickly.
- Optimized CI/CD pipelines: Faster startup times can lead to quicker feedback loops in continuous integration and
  deployment processes.
- Faster development cycles: Developers can iterate and test changes more rapidly.
- Improved resilience: Applications can recover from failures more quickly, maintaining availability.

## Technologies Used

- Java 21, Java 24
- Spring Boot 3.5.x
- Spring Native
- Spring Indexer
- Layertools
- CDS
- AOT
- Docker
- Docker Compose
- Maven

## Measurements

### Methodology

Each different type of configuration is built using a separate Dockerfile. The application is started in each
configuration, and the startup time is measured.

To simulate a real-world scenario, the application contains REST API and is configured to connect to a PostgreSQL
database. Liquibase is used to manage the database schema.

Additionally, **resources are limited** to **0.5 vCPU** and **768MB of memory** to simulate limited resources under the
Kubernetes Cluster.

### OS, Hardware, and Limits

### Measurements Results

#### Summary

#### Observations

- native image is by far the fastest option, starting in less than half a second, delivers 98.03% optimization compared
  to a worst case scenario
    - mind risks of using native image, especially regarding reflection, proxies, and other dynamic features of Java
    - in my case liquibase caused issues and had to be set to the specific version
- using unpacked layered jar with CDS provides the best performance among JVM-based options, reducing startup time by
  almost 30%
- using CDS without layered jars provides some improvement in startup time (almost 14%)
- using Spring Indexer provides a small improvement in startup time (1% - 4%)
- AOT does not provide as good improvements in startup time as CDS â€” this is surprising, as AOT is supposed to suppress
  CDS
- using layered jars provides a noticeable improvement in startup time compared to a standard jar
- combining multiple optimizations (e.g., unpacked layered jar + CDS) provides the best performance among
  JVM-based options

## How to Run

### Prerequisites

Some measurements require access to the application's database. You can use PostgreSQL running in a Docker container. To
start it, run the following command:

```bash
docker compose up
```

### Running Measurements

To run the measurements, execute each helper bash script. Each script will build the application for a specific
configuration and run it.

```bash
./Dockerfile-simple.sh
./Dockerfile-simple-indexer.sh
./Dockerfile-simple-cds.sh
./Dockerfile-simple-aot-cache.sh
./Dockerfile-layers.sh
./Dockerfile-layers-indexer.sh
./Dockerfile-layers-cds.sh
./Dockerfile-layers-aot-cache.sh
./Dockerfile-native.sh
```
