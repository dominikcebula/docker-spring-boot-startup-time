# Spring Boot Startup Times

## Introduction

TBD

## Why does startup time matter?

In modern cloud-native applications, startup time is an important factor. Faster startup times lead to:

- Improved scalability: Applications can scale up more quickly in response to demand.
- Reduced cold start latency: Particularly important for serverless applications where functions need to start quickly.
- Optimized CI/CD pipelines: Faster startup times can lead to quicker feedback loops in continuous integration and
  deployment processes.
- Faster development cycles: Developers can iterate and test changes more rapidly.
- Improved resilience: Applications can recover from failures more quickly, maintaining availability.

## Measurement Results

### Summary

### Conclusions

- native image is by far the fastest option, starting in less than half a second, delivers 98.03% optimization compared
  to a worst case scenario
    - mind risks of using native image, especially regarding reflection, proxies, and other dynamic features of Java
    - in my case liquibase caused issues and had to be set to the specific version
- using unpacked layered jar with CDS provides the best performance among JVM-based options, reducing startup time by
  almost 30%
- using CDS without layered jars provides some improvement in startup time (almost 14%)
- using Spring Indexer provides a small improvement in startup time (1% - 3%)
- AOT does not provide as good improvements in startup time as CDS, CDS is faster by 6.95% for unpacked layer case and
  faster by 12.72% for app jar case â€” this is surprising, as AOT is supposed to suppress
  CDS
- using layered jars provides a noticeable improvement in startup time compared to a standard jar

## Methodology

### How did I measure startup time?

Startup time for each different type of configuration was measured under an isolated Docker run with limited
resources (CPU: 0.5 vCPU, Memory: 768MB RAM), to simulate execution under container runtime (for example, Kubernetes)
with limited resources assigned to each POD.

To get closer to a real-world scenario, the application contains REST API and is configured to connect to a PostgreSQL
database. Liquibase is used to manage the database schema.

### How to reproduce the results?
