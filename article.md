# Spring Boot Startup Times

## Introduction

Spring Boot is a popular framework for building Java applications, widely adopted in cloud-native and containerized
environments. As applications increasingly run in dynamic infrastructures like Kubernetes, startup time has become a
critical metric, impacting scalability, resilience, and developer productivity.

This article investigates how different build and runtime configurations affect the startup time of a Spring Boot
application.

## Why does startup time matter?

In modern cloud-native applications, startup time is an important factor. Faster startup times lead to:

- Improved scalability: Applications can scale up more quickly in response to demand.
- Reduced cold start latency: Particularly important for serverless applications where functions need to start quickly.
- Optimized CI/CD pipelines: Faster startup times can lead to quicker feedback loops in continuous integration and
  deployment processes.
- Faster development cycles: Developers can iterate and test changes more rapidly.
- Improved resilience: Applications can recover from failures more quickly, maintaining availability.

## Measurement Results

### Conclusions

- native image is by far the fastest option, starting in less than half a second, delivers 98.03% optimization compared
  to a worst case scenario
    - mind risks of using native image, especially regarding reflection, proxies, and other dynamic features of Java
    - in my case liquibase caused issues and had to be set to the specific version
- using unpacked layered jar with CDS provides the best performance among JVM-based options, reducing startup time by
  almost 30%
- using CDS without layered jars provides some improvement in startup time (almost 14%)
- using Spring Indexer provides a small improvement in startup time (1% - 3%)
- AOT Cache does not provide as good improvements in startup time as CDS, CDS is faster by 6.95% for unpacked layer case
  and
  faster by 12.72% for app jar case â€” this is surprising, as AOT Cache is supposed to suppress
  CDS
- using layered jars provides a noticeable improvement in startup time compared to a standard jar

## Methodology

### How did I measure startup time?

Startup time for each different type of configuration was measured under an isolated Docker run with limited
resources (CPU: 0.5 vCPU, Memory: 768MB RAM), to simulate execution under container runtime (for example, Kubernetes)
with limited resources assigned to each POD.

To get closer to a real-world scenario, the application contains REST API and is configured to connect to a PostgreSQL
database. Liquibase is used to manage the database schema.

## Summary

In this article, I explored various strategies to optimize the startup time of a Spring Boot application. The
configurations tested included standard application jars, layered jars, the use of the Spring Indexer, Class Data
Sharing (CDS), AOT Cache, and native images. Each configuration was measured in a controlled
Docker environment to simulate real-world deployment scenarios with limited resources.

The measurements clearly show that the choice of runtime configuration has a significant impact on Spring Boot
application startup time. The native image approach delivers the fastest startup by a wide margin, starting in less than
half a second and achieving a 98% reduction compared to the baseline fat jar. Among JVM-based options, using unpacked
layered jars with Class Data Sharing (CDS) provides the best improvement, reducing startup time by nearly 30%. Layered
jars alone and the use of the Spring Indexer offer moderate gains, while AOT compilation with the current setup does not
outperform CDS. These results highlight that, for most JVM deployments, combining layered jars with CDS is the most
effective way to optimize startup time without the complexity and limitations of native images.
